# Snake JS, Group Project
[Turing School Module 4 JavaScript Project](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) - Worked with Amber Crawford, Forked from our [Original Repo](https://github.com/sekharp/game-time)<br>
* We created the classic game Snake as an application hosted on GitHub Pages. Includes a party mode with trailing colors behind the snake, moving to the song "All Night Long" by Lionel Richie.
* I handled rendering the canvas, the drawing and growth of the snake and building a scoreboard.<br><br>
**Tech stack: JavaScript, HTML5, Node, jQuery, Materialize and Chai**
